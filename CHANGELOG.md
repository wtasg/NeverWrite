# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to NeverWrite will be documented in this file.

## Format

This changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

Entries are grouped by release version under the following categories:

- **Added** — New features
- **Changed** — Changes to existing functionality
- **Fixed** — Bug fixes
- **Removed** — Removed features
- **Security** — Vulnerability fixes

## Versioning

NeverWrite uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with `0.x` releases
during the beta phase. The minor version increments with each release — there
is no upper limit before `1.0`. The `1.0` release signals a stable, public API
and UX commitment.

```
0.1 → 0.2 → ... → 0.47 → ... → 1.0
```

Patch versions (`0.x.1`, `0.x.2`) are reserved for hotfixes within a release.

## What belongs here

Only changes that matter to users who download and use NeverWrite. Internal
refactors, dependency updates, CI changes, and code cleanup do not belong here.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added file-tree context menu actions to add notes, folders, PDFs, and sidebar files directly to the current chat composer as context pills.
- Added "Add to New Chat" and "Add Selected to New Chat" actions from the file tree, opening a fresh agent chat with the currently selected/last active provider before attaching the chosen context.
- Added multi-selection-aware chat context actions for selected notes and sidebar files in the file tree.
- Added local app diagnostics logs for Electron main, renderer, and native backend events, with documented log locations and privacy notes.
- Added saved-chat crash recovery docs and recovery flow for AI conversations stored locally under each vault's `.neverwrite/sessions/` directory.
- Added native saved-session resume support for Codex when available, with a saved-transcript fallback path when direct runtime resume is unavailable or fails.

### Changed

- Changed file-tree path copy actions to consistently use "Copy Full Path" and copy absolute paths for notes, folders, PDFs, and sidebar files.

### Fixed

- Fixed external vault refresh handling so ambiguous external deletes, including folders that look like Markdown notes, refresh the vault structure instead of leaving the file tree stale.
- Fixed closing active AI agent tabs so NeverWrite asks for confirmation consistently, including Cmd/Ctrl+W and multi-tab close paths. Thanks to @wtasg for the first contribution!
- Fixed Codex saved chats so restored, detached, resumed, or crash-recovered sessions keep enough transcript context to continue without losing the prior conversation.
- Fixed Codex subagent breadcrumb `Open` actions so they continue working after restore or resume even when the live `sessionId` differs from the saved history or runtime session id.
- Fixed detached windows and tab reattachment for AI chats so related parent, child, and sibling subagent sessions transfer and hydrate together instead of losing the agent tree.
- Fixed file-tree chat context targeting so context menu actions and drops attach to the intended chat, including newly opened chats whose composer is still mounting.
- Fixed normal native backend shutdown so expected sidecar exits no longer appear as app errors.

### Security

- Hardened diagnostic log redaction for prompt, transcript, message, content, token, secret, authorization, and API key fields, including `apiKey`, `api_key`, `api-key`, and `x-api-key` variants.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added a "release notes" button in Settings → Updates that opens the latest GitHub release in the user's browser.
- Added pane-native drag and drop for Agents sidebar threads: drag a chat or subagent from the sidebar onto a pane, tab strip, or pane edge to open it there, move the existing chat tab without duplicating it, or create a new split pane.
- Added a floating drag preview for Agents sidebar threads, including the thread title, runtime, and active/error state while dragging.

### Changed

- Changed file-tree drag behavior so dropping existing notes, PDFs, and files onto editor panes opens them as tabs instead of inserting embed markup into the active note.
- Changed file-tree and external file drops to use the same pane-native targeting as workspace tabs: drop on a pane center to open there, on a tab strip to choose the tab position, or on a pane edge to create a split. Drops over the AI composer still attach to the chat composer instead of opening editor panes.
- Polished the chat composer expand/collapse button: the diagonal arrows now point toward the natural corners (top-right / bottom-left when collapsed, inward when expanded) and the button gains a subtle hover highlight that matches the other composer controls.

### Fixed

- Fixed AI chat tabs restored from saved history so their `persisted:*` identifiers no longer leak into live runtime commands, preventing repeated "AI session not found" errors when switching between a Markdown note and an empty or saved chat in the same pane.
- Fixed workspace tab dragging so file-attachment drag events emitted by tabs no longer clear the pane split/drop preview.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Updated the embedded Claude ACP runtime to the latest upstream `0.31.4` snapshot, keeping NeverWrite aligned with Claude Code `v2.1.123` and picking up upstream runtime dependency fixes.

### Security

- Updated the embedded Claude ACP runtime's vendored dependencies to include upstream Hono security fixes for JSX tag validation and chunked request body limits.

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex subagent threads so their sidebar `Working` state now follows the child agent's own turn lifecycle instead of relying on parent-thread breadcrumbs.
- Fixed subagent completion handling so child threads return to idle when their ACP turn completes, aborts, or shuts down, even when the parent thread is not actively open.
- Fixed stale Codex subagent turn completion events so an older completed turn can no longer mark a reactivated child agent as idle while it is already working on a newer turn.
- Fixed subagent reactivation so resumed or still-running child agents are no longer incorrectly marked idle by parent `interaction_end`, `resume_end`, or `waiting_end` breadcrumbs.
- Fixed subagent reactivation in the sidebar so live child sessions can return to `Working` from backend lifecycle updates while root sessions remain protected from stale streaming updates.
- Fixed multi-subagent waiting updates so a completed child no longer causes every sibling subagent under the same parent to stop showing as working.
- Fixed Codex ACP lifecycle projection by emitting structured turn lifecycle metadata and structured waiting-status metadata for subagents.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Added Web Clipper release artifacts to the `0.2.1` GitHub Release pipeline, including Chrome MV3 manual-install and Firefox MV3 testing/signing zips.
- Added working ChatGPT account sign-in for the Codex runtime through the ACP authentication flow, including backend logout support.
- Added Anthropic API key sign-in as an explicit Claude provider option.

### Changed

- Hardened Claude sign-in options so remote or no-browser environments use the appropriate terminal login method, while local environments keep Claude subscription, Anthropic Console, API key, and gateway choices.
- Hardened Gemini Google sign-in so the terminal launch explicitly maps the UI method to the Gemini CLI `oauth-personal` auth type instead of relying on ambiguous defaults.

### Fixed

- Fixed AI provider setup status so finding a runtime binary no longer incorrectly marks the provider as connected.
- Fixed terminal sign-in state so providers become connected only after the sign-in process exits successfully.
- Fixed AI sign-in terminals so refreshes no longer restart the active auth session or reopen duplicate browser tabs.
- Fixed AI sign-in terminals so they open focused and scrolled to the beginning of the auth prompt, allowing interactive choices such as Gemini Google sign-in to receive Enter correctly.
- Fixed AI provider setup recognition after restart by detecting persisted CLI account credentials for Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Kilo.
- Fixed AI provider logout so local auth state and Google Cloud environment settings are cleared consistently.
- Fixed Claude gateway setup so remote HTTP URLs are rejected by the backend, localhost HTTP remains allowed, and gateway-with-token setups stay labeled as gateway auth.
- Fixed Windows runtime lookup for CLI shims that depend on `PATHEXT`, such as `.cmd` and `.exe` launchers.
- Fixed Gemini startup on Windows so NeverWrite prefers the executable `.cmd` shim over npm's extensionless shim, avoiding `CreateProcessW` Win32 launch failures.
- Fixed Gemini Google sign-in hydration so NeverWrite marks the provider as connected as soon as the Gemini CLI reports successful authentication, instead of waiting for the login terminal process to exit.
- Fixed Gemini ACP sessions on Windows by stripping verbatim `\\?\` path prefixes before launching the Node-based CLI, avoiding `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, lstat 'C:'` failures.
- Fixed Gemini model and mode changes so NeverWrite uses Gemini's supported ACP `session/set_model` and `session/set_mode` requests instead of the unsupported `session/set_config_option` request.
- Fixed Codex subagent persistence so background subagent threads are saved when they are created or receive tool, status, plan, image, permission, or input events while their chat tab is closed, using the subagent's own vault path for delayed saves.
- Documented a Codex subagent edge case where models may try to combine a full-history fork with explicit child role, model, or reasoning-effort overrides; Codex rejects that combination and the parent may retry visibly with a non-forked launch.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added GitHub Release downloads for the Web Clipper: a Chrome MV3 zip for manual install and a Firefox MV3 build artifact for testing/signing workflows.
- Added **Codex subagents as first-class** sidebar sessions, so running agents stay available even after their chat tabs are closed. Please welcome your copernicos and galileos!
- Added dedicated threads for each Codex subagent, **including independent review tabs and inline review for file changes made by each agent**.
- Added **parent chat breadcrumbs with inline actions for opening subagent threads**, plus persistent parent-child grouping across restarts.

### Changed

- Removed the redundant collapse-all control from the note outline so the panel starts directly with the document structure while preserving per-section collapsing.
- Aligned file-oriented search across Search Files & Notes, New Tab, `@` mentions, and `[[ ]]` wikilink suggestions so all-files mode treats Markdown notes as files first, ranking file name and path matches before note title matches while keeping title search as a fallback.
- Updated wikilink suggestions in all-files mode to display Markdown note file names consistently with the file extension setting, so notes can appear as `example.md` when extensions are enabled without changing the inserted wikilink target.
- Made the wikilink suggestion popup horizontally scrollable so long note names and vault paths can be inspected without widening the popup.

### Fixed

- Fixed a mismatch where the file-oriented search notice promised file-name-first behavior, but Search Files & Notes and New Tab still used older title/path scoring.
- Fixed `@` mention suggestions in all-files mode so note titles remain searchable as a fallback after file name and path matches.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Fixed macOS DMG release validation so GitHub-built desktop release artifacts are staged and checked correctly.
- Fixed opening and using vaults on Windows rclone/WinFsp mounted drives that do not support path canonicalization, without compromising security layer.
- Fixed the drag preview disappearing when dragging items from an expanded sidebar onto editor panes or the chat composer.
- Fixed sticky folder headers in the file tree so they read as a distinct frosted plate, with the same visible blur treatment in both the docked sidebar and the Arc-style peek overlay.
- Fixed detached windows so agent conversations, review tabs, and terminal tabs keep their state when opened, moved, or reattached across windows.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed the GitHub-built desktop app packaging so the bundled Claude ACP runtime includes its production dependencies.
- Prevented a failed AI runtime startup from blocking provider settings, note loading, and other backend requests indefinitely.
- Improved AI provider settings so providers show as checking while runtime inventory is loading instead of incorrectly offering installs.

## [0.1.0]

- First release. For full changelog, the commit history is available, from the first line of code to the last.
